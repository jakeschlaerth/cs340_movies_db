            <h2>Movies Database</h2>
            <p>
                It is rather difficult for a user to see additional work of a
                director, composer, and actors in a movie. It can also be difficult to
                cross reference movies that
                fall in multiple genres. This relational database will organize
                these types of data
                in a way that will allow the user to easily see additional work
                by each director,
                composer, and actor, as well as see movies that share at least
                one genre.
                This database will include the top 100 movies released each
                year, based on
                total box office.
